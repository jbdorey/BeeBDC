  Often serves as a link between field notes and an Occurrence record,
  such as a specimen collector's number.

- recordedBy:

  A list (concatenated and separated) of names of people, groups, or
  organizations responsible for recording the original Occurrence. The
  primary collector or observer, especially one who applies a personal
  identifier (recordNumber), should be listed first.

- eventID:

  An identifier for the set of information associated with an Event
  (something that occurs at a place and time). May be a global unique
  identifier or an identifier specific to the data set.

  The horizontal distance (in meters) from the given decimalLatitude and
  decimalLongitude describing the smallest circle containing the whole
  of the Location. Leave the value empty if the uncertainty is unknown,
  cannot be estimated, or is not applicable (because there are no
  coordinates). Zero is not a valid value for this term.

- spatiallyValid:

  valid flag. This flag combines a set of tests applied to the record to
  see how reliable are its spatial data components.
