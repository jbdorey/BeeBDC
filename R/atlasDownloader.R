##### 1. atlasDownloader ####
#' Download occurrence data from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)
#'
#'
#' Downloads ALA data and creates a new file in the path to put those data. This function can also
#' request downloads from other atlases (see: http://galah.ala.org.au/articles/choosing_an_atlas.html).
#' However, it will only send the download to your email and you must do the rest yourself at this point.
#' 
#' @param path A character directory. The path to a folder where the download will be stored.
#' @param userEmail A character string. The email used associated with the userâ€™s ALA account; 
#' user must make an ALA account to download data. 
#' @param ALA_taxon A character string. The taxon to download from ALA. Uses [galah::galah_identify()]
#' @param DL_reason Numeric. The reason for data download according to [galah::galah_config()]
#' @param atlas Character. The atlas to download occurrence data from - see here https://galah.ala.org.au/R/articles/choosing_an_atlas.html for details.
#' Note: the default is "ALA" and is probably the only atlas which will work seamlessly with the rest
#' of the workflow. However, different atlases can still be downloaded and a doi will be sent to 
#' your email.
#'
#' @return Completes an ALA data download and saves those data to the path provided.
