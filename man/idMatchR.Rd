\title{Attempt to match database_ids from a prior run}
\usage{
idMatchR(
  currentData = NULL,
  priorData = NULL,
  matchBy = NULL,
  completeness_cols = NULL,
  excludeDataset = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{currentData}{A data frame or tibble. The NEW occurrence records as input.}

\item{priorData}{A data frame or tibble. The PRIOR occurrence records as input.}

\item{matchBy}{User-provided list of columns to iteratively compare.}

\item{completeness_cols}{A character vector. The columns to check for completeness, arrange,
and keep the relevant prior database_id.}

\item{excludeDataset}{A character vector. The dataSources that are to be excluded from data matching.
These should be static dataSources from minor providers.}
}
\value{
The input data frame returned with a new column that shows the updated database_ids
as in priorData where they could be matched
}

  # You can exclude datasets from prior by matching their prefixs â€” before first underscore:
